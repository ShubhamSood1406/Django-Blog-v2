# Django-Blog-v2

BlogExpress is an web-application based on Django framework where a user can upload their blogs. I used HTML with Bootstrap CDN (Content Delivery Network) to designing the web page and use Bootstrap's nav-bar for navigation bar and Bootstrap's modal for login and add blog pop up so that user can login and add content of blog.
